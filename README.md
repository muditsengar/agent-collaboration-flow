# Real-Time Multi-Agent Collaboration with Traces

## Overview
This project implements a multi-agent system that can rapidly collaborate to solve complex tasks. The system uses a combination of specialized agents that work together to process user requests, with real-time traceability of the agents' decision-making process.

## Project Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
- **Specialized Agents**: The system consists of multiple specialized agents, each handling different aspects of problem-solving
- **Real-Time Communication**: Agents communicate through WebSocket connections, enabling seamless message passing and shared context
- **Traceability**: All agent interactions and decision-making processes are logged and displayed in real-time

### Key Features
- Real-time agent collaboration
- Transparent decision-making process
- Web-based user interface
- Scalable agent architecture
- Rapid AI-assisted development

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - Vite
  - TypeScript
  - React
  - shadcn-ui
  - Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**:
  - Python
  - WebSocket for real-time communication
  - Custom agent framework

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js & npm
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Installation Steps
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/muditsengar/agent-collaboration-flow

# Navigate to the project directory
cd agent-collaboration-flow

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Start the development servers
npm run dev  # Frontend
cd backend && python main.py  # Backend
```

## Usage
1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080`
2. Enter your complex task request
3. Watch the agents collaborate in real-time
4. View the trace output showing agent interactions
5. Receive the consolidated solution

## System Architecture
The system consists of:
1. **Web Interface**: User-friendly frontend for task input and result visualization
2. **Agent Manager**: Coordinates agent communication and task distribution
3. **Specialized Agents**: Individual agents with specific capabilities
4. **Trace System**: Real-time logging and visualization of agent interactions

## Scalability & Extensibility
- New agents can be added without system overhaul
- Modular architecture allows for easy integration of new capabilities
- WebSocket-based communication enables distributed deployment

## Deployment
The project can be deployed using:
1. Traditional server deployment
2. Containerized deployment (Docker)
3. Cloud platform deployment
